       " 'I left at sunset (as I had been warned to do),\\nand I walked on, that night and half next day, until I met (as I was\\nwarned I should) this comrade',\n",
       " '\\n\"Are you sure,\" asked Jacques Two, of Defarge, \"that no embarrassment\\ncan arise from our manner of keeping the register',\n",
       " 'Without doubt it is\\nsafe, for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it; but shall we always\\nbe able to decipher it--or, I ought to say, will she',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\"Jacques,\" returned Defarge, drawing himself up, \"if madame my wife\\nundertook to keep the register in her memory alone, she would not lose\\na word of it--not a syllable of it',\n",
       " 'It would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives,\\nto erase himself from existence, than to erase one letter of his name or\\ncrimes from the knitted register of Madame Defarge',\n",
       " '\\n\\nThere was a murmur of confidence and approval, and then the man who\\nhungered, asked: \"Is this rustic to be sent back soon',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\"He knows nothing,\" said Defarge; \"at least nothing more than would\\neasily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height',\n",
       " 'He wishes to see the fine world--the King, the Queen, and\\nCourt; let him see them on Sunday',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\"Jacques,\" said Defarge; \"judiciously show a cat milk, if you wish her\\nto thirst for it',\n",
       " '\\n\\nNothing more was said, and the mender of roads, being found already\\ndozing on the topmost stair, was advised to lay himself down on the\\npallet-bed and take some rest',\n",
       " \"\\nWorse quarters than Defarge's wine-shop, could easily have been found\\nin Paris for a provincial slave of that degree\",\n",
       " 'But, madame sat all day at her counter, so expressly\\nunconscious of him, and so particularly determined not to perceive that\\nhis being there had any connection with anything below the surface, that\\nhe shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted on her',\n",
       " 'For, he\\ncontended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady\\nmight pretend next; and he felt assured that if she should take it\\ninto her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a\\nmurder and afterwards flay the victim, she would infallibly go through\\nwith it until the play was played out',\n",
       " '\\nTherefore, when Sunday came, the mender of roads was not enchanted\\n(though he said he was) to find that madame was to accompany monsieur\\nand himself to Versailles',\n",
       " 'It was additionally disconcerting to have\\nmadame knitting all the way there, in a public conveyance; it was\\nadditionally disconcerting yet, to have madame in the crowd in the\\nafternoon, still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to\\nsee the carriage of the King and Queen',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\"For instance--\"\\n\\n\"For instance,\" returned Madame Defarge, composedly, \"shrouds',\n",
       " '\\n\\nThe man moved a little further away, as soon as he could, and the mender\\nof roads fanned himself with his blue cap: feeling it mightily close\\nand oppressive',\n",
       " \"If he needed a King and Queen to restore him, he was\\nfortunate in having his remedy at hand; for, soon the large-faced King\\nand the fair-faced Queen came in their golden coach, attended by the\\nshining Bull's Eye of their Court, a glittering multitude of laughing\\nladies and fine lords; and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour\\nand elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both\\nsexes, the mender of roads bathed himself, so much to his temporary\\nintoxication, that he cried Long live the King, Long live the Queen,\\nLong live everybody and everything\",\n",
       " \"Then, there were gardens, courtyards,\\nterraces, fountains, green banks, more King and Queen, more Bull's Eye,\\nmore lords and ladies, more Long live they all\",\n",
       " 'During the whole of this scene, which lasted some three\\nhours, he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company,\\nand throughout Defarge held him by the collar, as if to restrain him\\nfrom flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to\\npieces',\n",
       " ' said Defarge, clapping him on the back when it was over, like a\\npatron; \"you are a good boy',\n",
       " '\\n\"You are the fellow we want,\" said Defarge, in his ear; \"you make\\nthese fools believe that it will last for ever',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\"If you were shown a great heap of dolls, and were set upon them to\\npluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage, you would\\npick out the richest and gayest',\n",

       " '\\n\\n\"You have seen both dolls and birds to-day,\" said Madame Defarge, with\\na wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent;\\n\"now, go home',\n",
       " 'Still Knitting\\n\\nMadame Defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the\\nbosom of Saint Antoine, while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the\\ndarkness, and through the dust, and down the weary miles of avenue by\\nthe wayside, slowly tending towards that point of the compass where\\nthe chateau of Monsieur the Marquis, now in his grave, listened to\\nthe whispering trees',\n",
       " 'Such ample leisure had the stone faces, now,\\nfor listening to the trees and to the fountain, that the few village\\nscarecrows who, in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead\\nstick to burn, strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and\\nterrace staircase, had it borne in upon their starved fancy that\\nthe expression of the faces was altered',\n",
       " 'A rumour just lived in the\\nvillage--had a faint and bare existence there, as its people had--that\\nwhen the knife struck home, the faces changed, from faces of pride to\\nfaces of anger and pain; also, that when that dangling figure was hauled\\nup forty feet above the fountain, they changed again, and bore a cruel\\nlook of being avenged, which they would henceforth bear for ever',\n",
       " 'In the\\nstone face over the great window of the bed-chamber where the murder\\nwas done, two fine dints were pointed out in the sculptured nose, which\\neverybody recognised, and which nobody had seen of old; and on the\\nscarce occasions when two or three ragged peasants emerged from the\\ncrowd to take a hurried peep at Monsieur the Marquis petrified, a\\nskinny finger would not have pointed to it for a minute, before they all\\nstarted away among the moss and leaves, like the more fortunate hares\\nwho could find a living there',\n",
       " '\\nChateau and hut, stone face and dangling figure, the red stain on the\\nstone floor, and the pure water in the village well--thousands of acres\\nof land--a whole province of France--all France itself--lay under the\\nnight sky, concentrated into a faint hair-breadth line',\n",
       " 'And as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse\\nthe manner of its composition, so, sublimer intelligences may read in\\nthe feeble shining of this earth of ours, every thought and act, every\\nvice and virtue, of every responsible creature on it',\n",
       " '\\nThe Defarges, husband and wife, came lumbering under the starlight,\\nin their public vehicle, to that gate of Paris whereunto their\\njourney naturally tended',\n",
       " 'There was the usual stoppage at the barrier\\nguardhouse, and the usual lanterns came glancing forth for the usual\\nexamination and inquiry',\n",
       " '\\nWhen Saint Antoine had again enfolded the Defarges in his dusky wings,\\nand they, having finally alighted near the Saint\\'s boundaries, were\\npicking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his\\nstreets, Madame Defarge spoke to her husband:\\n\\n\"Say then, my friend; what did Jacques of the police tell thee',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\"Barsad,\" said Defarge, making it French by pronunciation',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\"Age, about forty years; height, about five feet nine; black hair;\\ncomplexion dark; generally, rather handsome visage; eyes dark, face\\nthin, long, and sallow; nose aquiline, but not straight, having a\\npeculiar inclination towards the left cheek; expression, therefore,\\nsinister',\n",
       " '\\n\\nThey turned into the wine-shop, which was closed (for it was midnight),\\nand where Madame Defarge immediately took her post at her desk, counted\\nthe small moneys that had been taken during her absence, examined the\\nstock, went through the entries in the book, made other entries of\\nher own, checked the serving man in every possible way, and finally\\ndismissed him to bed',\n",
       " 'All this while, Defarge, with his pipe in his mouth, walked\\nup and down, complacently admiring, but never interfering; in which\\ncondition, indeed, as to the business and his domestic affairs, he\\nwalked up and down through life',\n",
       " \"Monsieur Defarge's olfactory sense was\\nby no means delicate, but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than\\nit ever tasted, and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed\",\n",
       " '\\n\"You are a little depressed, too,\" said madame, whose quick eyes had\\nnever been so intent on the accounts, but they had had a ray or two for\\nhim',\n",
       " '\\n\"But when it is ready, it takes place, and grinds to pieces everything\\nbefore it',\n",
       " 'Look around and consider the lives of all the world\\nthat we know, consider the faces of all the world that we know, consider\\nthe rage and discontent to which the Jacquerie addresses itself with\\nmore and more of certainty every hour',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\"My brave wife,\" returned Defarge, standing before her with his head\\na little bent, and his hands clasped at his back, like a docile and\\nattentive pupil before his catechist, \"I do not question all this',\n",
       " 'But\\nit has lasted a long time, and it is possible--you know well, my wife,\\nit is possible--that it may not come, during our lives',\n",
       " 'But even if not, even if I knew\\ncertainly not, show me the neck of an aristocrat and tyrant, and still I\\nwould--\"\\n\\nThen madame, with her teeth set, tied a very terrible knot indeed',\n",
       " 'When the time comes, let loose a tiger and a devil; but wait for the\\ntime with the tiger and the devil chained--not shown--yet always ready',\n",
       " '\\n\\nMadame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her\\nlittle counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its brains\\nout, and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her arm in a serene\\nmanner, and observing that it was time to go to bed',\n",
       " '\\nNext noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the\\nwine-shop, knitting away assiduously',\n",
       " 'The day was very hot,\\nand heaps of flies, who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous\\nperquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame, fell\\ndead at the bottom',\n",
       " 'Their decease made no impression on the other flies\\nout promenading, who looked at them in the coolest manner (as if they\\nthemselves were elephants, or something as far removed), until they met\\nthe same fate',\n",
       " 'The moment Madame Defarge took up the rose, the\\ncustomers ceased talking, and began gradually to drop out of the\\nwine-shop',\n",
       " 'Good day, age about forty, height about five feet nine, black\\nhair, generally rather handsome visage, complexion dark, eyes dark,\\nthin, long and sallow face, aquiline nose but not straight, having a\\npeculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister\\nexpression',\n",
       " '\\n\\nIt was the first time it had ever been so complimented, and Madame\\nDefarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better',\n",
       " 'The\\nvisitor watched her fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity\\nof observing the place in general',\n",
       " 'If I do--Well,\" said\\nmadame, drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of\\ncoquetry, \"I\\'ll use it',\n",
       " '\\n\\nIt was remarkable; but, the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be\\ndecidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge',\n",
       " 'Two\\nmen had entered separately, and had been about to order drink, when,\\ncatching sight of that novelty, they faltered, made a pretence of\\nlooking about as if for some friend who was not there, and went away',\n",
       " 'They had lounged away in a\\npoverty-stricken, purposeless, accidental manner, quite natural and\\nunimpeachable',\n",
       " '\"Stay long enough, and I shall knit\\n\\'BARSAD\\' before you go',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\"As _you_ say,\" madame retorted, correcting him, and deftly knitting an\\nextra something into his name that boded him no good',\n",
       " \"\\n\\nThe spy, who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make, did\\nnot allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face; but,\\nstood with an air of gossiping gallantry, leaning his elbow on Madame\\nDefarge's little counter, and occasionally sipping his cognac\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n\"I believe,\" said the spy, dropping his soft voice to a tone\\nthat invited confidence, and expressing an injured revolutionary\\nsusceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face: \"I believe there\\nis much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood, touching the poor\\nfellow',\n",
       " '\\nAs the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door, the spy saluted\\nhim by touching his hat, and saying, with an engaging smile, \"Good day,\\nJacques',\n",
       " \"\\n\\nHaving said it, he passed behind the little counter, and stood with his\\nhand on the back of his wife's chair, looking over that barrier at the\\nperson to whom they were both opposed, and whom either of them would\\nhave shot with the greatest satisfaction\",\n",
       " '\\n\"The pleasure of conversing with you, Monsieur Defarge, recalls to me,\"\\npursued the spy, \"that I have the honour of cherishing some interesting\\nassociations with your name',\n",
       " 'When Doctor Manette was released, you, his old domestic,\\nhad the charge of him, I know',\n",
       " '\\n\"It was to you,\" said the spy, \"that his daughter came; and it was\\nfrom your care that his daughter took him, accompanied by a neat brown\\nmonsieur; how is he called',\n",
       " '-in a little wig--Lorry--of the bank of\\nTellson and Company--over to England',\n",
       " '\\n\"In effect,\" madame struck in, looking up from her work and her little\\nsong, \"we never hear about them',\n",
       " 'We received the news of their safe\\narrival, and perhaps another letter, or perhaps two; but, since then,\\nthey have gradually taken their road in life--we, ours--and we have held\\nno correspondence',\n",

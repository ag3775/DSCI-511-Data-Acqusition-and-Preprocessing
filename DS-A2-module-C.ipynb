Exit\\n\\n                       Enter MARINERS\\n\\n  BOATSWAIN. Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!\\n    yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to th' master's\\n    whistle.

Where's the master?\\n    Play the men.\\n  BOATSWAIN. I pray now, keep below.\\n  ANTONIO. Where is the master, boson?\\n  BOATSWAIN. Do you not hear him? You mar our labour;\\n    keep your cabins; you do assist the storm.\\n  GONZALO. Nay, good, be patient.\\n  BOATSWAIN. When the sea is. Hence! What cares these\\n    roarers for the name of king? To cabin! silence! Trouble\\n    us not.\\n  GONZALO. Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.\\n  BOATSWAIN. None that I more love than myself. You are\\n    counsellor; if you can command these elements to\\n    silence, and work the peace of the present, we will not\\n    hand a rope more. Use your authority; if you cannot, give\\n    thanks you have liv'd so long, and make yourself ready\\n    in your cabin for the mischance of the hour, if it so\\n    hap.-Cheerly, good hearts!-Out of our way, I say.\\n Exit\\n  GONZALO. I have great comfort from this fellow. Methinks\\n    he hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is\\n    perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his hanging;\\n    make the rope of his destiny our cable, for our own doth\\n    little advantage.

They are louder than the\\n    weather or our office.\\n\\n           Re-enter SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, and GONZALO\\n\\n    Yet again! What do you here? Shall we give o'er, and\\n    drown? Have you a mind to sink?\\n  SEBASTIAN. A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,\\n    incharitable dog!\\n  BOATSWAIN. Work you, then.\\n  ANTONIO. Hang, cur; hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker;\\n    we are less afraid to be drown'd than thou art.\\n  GONZALO. I'll warrant him for drowning, though the ship were\\n    no stronger than a nutshell, and as leaky as an unstanched\\n    wench.\\n  BOATSWAIN. Lay her a-hold, a-hold; set her two courses; off\\n    to sea again; lay her off.\\n\\n                    Enter MARINERS, Wet\\n  MARINERS.

We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards.\\n    This wide-chopp'd rascal-would thou mightst lie drowning\\n    The washing of ten tides!\\n  GONZALO.

If by your art, my dearest father, you have\\n    Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.\\n    The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,\\n    But that the sea, mounting to th' welkin's cheek,\\n    Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered\\n    With those that I saw suffer! A brave vessel,\\n    Who had no doubt some noble creature in her,\\n    Dash'd all to pieces! O, the cry did knock\\n    Against my very heart! Poor souls, they perish'd.\\n    Had I been any god of power, I would\\n    Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere\\n    It should the good ship so have swallow'd and\\n    The fraughting souls within her.\\n  PROSPERO. Be conected;\\n    No more amazement; tell your piteous heart\\n    There's no harm done.\\n  MIRANDA. O, woe the day!\\n  PROSPERO. No harm.\\n    I have done nothing but in care of thee,\\n    Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who\\n    Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing\\n    Of whence I am, nor that I am more better\\n    Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,\\n    And thy no greater father.\\n  MIRANDA. More to know\\n    Did never meddle with my thoughts.\\n  PROSPERO. 'Tis time\\n    I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,\\n    And pluck my magic garment from me. So,\\n                                          [Lays down his mantle]\\n    Lie there my art.

You have often\\n    Begun to tell me what I am; but stopp'd,\\n    And left me to a bootless inquisition,\\n    Concluding 'Stay; not yet.'\\n  PROSPERO. The hour's now come;\\n    The very minute bids thee ope thine ear.\\n    Obey, and be attentive. Canst thou remember\\n    A time before we came unto this cell?\\n    I do not think thou canst; for then thou wast not\\n    Out three years old.\\n  MIRANDA. Certainly, sir, I can.\\n  PROSPERO. By what? By any other house, or person?\\n    Of any thing the image, tell me, that\\n    Hath kept with thy remembrance?\\n  MIRANDA. 'Tis far off,\\n    And rather like a dream than an assurance\\n    That my remembrance warrants. Had I not\\n    Four, or five, women once, that tended me?\\n  PROSPERO. Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it\\n    That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else\\n    In the dark backward and abysm of time?\\n    If thou rememb'rest aught, ere thou cam'st here,\\n    How thou cam'st here thou mayst.\\n  MIRANDA. But that I do not.\\n  PROSPERO. Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,\\n    Thy father was the Duke of Milan, and\\n    A prince of power.\\n  MIRANDA. Sir, are not you my father?\\n  PROSPERO. Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and\\n    She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father\\n    Was Duke of Milan, and his only heir\\n    And princess no worse issued.\\n  MIRANDA. O, the heavens!\\n    What foul play had we that we came from thence?\\n    Or blessed was't we did?\\n  PROSPERO. Both, both, my girl.\\n    By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heav'd thence;\\n    But blessedly holp hither.\\n  MIRANDA. O, my heart bleeds\\n    To think o' th' teen that I have turn'd you to,\\n    Which is from my remembrance. Please you, farther.\\n  PROSPERO. My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio-\\n    I pray thee, mark me that a brother should\\n    Be so perfidious. He, whom next thyself\\n    Of all the world I lov'd, and to him put\\n    The manage of my state; as at that time\\n    Through all the signories it was the first,\\n    And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed\\n    In dignity, and for the liberal arts\\n    Without a parallel, those being all my study-\\n    The government I cast upon my brother\\n    And to my state grew stranger, being transported\\n    And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle-\\n    Dost thou attend me?\\n  MIRANDA. Sir, most heedfully.\\n  PROSPERO. Being once perfected how to grant suits,\\n    How to deny them, who t' advance, and who\\n    To trash for over-topping, new created\\n    The creatures that were mine, I say, or chang'd 'em,\\n    Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key\\n    Of officer and office, set all hearts i' th' state\\n    To what tune pleas'd his ear; that now he was\\n    The ivy which had hid my princely trunk\\n    And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.\\n  MIRANDA. O, good sir, I do!\\n  PROSPERO. I pray thee, mark me.\\n    I thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated\\n    To closeness and the bettering of my mind\\n    With that which, but by being so retir'd,\\n    O'er-priz'd all popular rate, in my false brother\\n    Awak'd an evil nature; and my trust,\\n    Like a good parent, did beget of him\\n    A falsehood, in its contrary as great\\n    As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,\\n    A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,\\n    Not only with what my revenue yielded,\\n    But what my power might else exact, like one\\n    Who having into truth, by telling of it,\\n    Made such a sinner of his memory,\\n    To credit his own lie-he did believe\\n    He was indeed the Duke; out o' th' substitution,\\n    And executing th' outward face of royalty\\n    With all prerogative. Hence his ambition growing-\\n    Dost thou hear?\\n  MIRANDA. Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.\\n  PROSPERO. To have no screen between this part he play'd\\n    And him he play'd it for, he needs will be\\n    Absolute Milan. Me, poor man-my library\\n    Was dukedom large enough-of temporal royalties\\n    He thinks me now incapable; confederates,\\n    So dry he was for sway, wi' th' King of Naples,\\n    To give him annual tribute, do him homage,\\n    Subject his coronet to his crown, and bend\\n    The dukedom, yet unbow'd-alas, poor Milan!-\\n    To most ignoble stooping.\\n  MIRANDA. O the heavens!\\n  PROSPERO. Mark his condition, and th' event, then tell me\\n    If this might be a brother.\\n  MIRANDA. I should sin\\n    To think but nobly of my grandmother:\\n    Good wombs have borne bad sons.\\n  PROSPERO. Now the condition:\\n    This King of Naples, being an enemy\\n    To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;\\n    Which was, that he, in lieu o' th' premises,\\n    Of homage, and I know not how much tribute,\\n    Should presently extirpate me and mine\\n    Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan\\n    With all the honours on my brother. Whereon,\\n    A treacherous army levied, one midnight\\n    Fated to th' purpose, did Antonio open\\n    The gates of Milan; and, i' th' dead of darkness,\\n    The ministers for th' purpose hurried thence\\n    Me and thy crying self.\\n  MIRANDA. Alack, for pity!\\n    I, not rememb'ring how I cried out then,\\n    Will cry it o'er again; it is a hint\\n    That wrings mine eyes to't.\\n  PROSPERO. Hear a little further,\\n    And then I'll bring thee to the present busines\\n    Which now's upon 's; without the which this story\\n    Were most impertinent.\\n  MIRANDA. Wherefore did they not\\n    That hour destroy us?\\n  PROSPERO. Well demanded, wench!\\n    My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,\\n    So dear the love my people bore me; nor set\\n    A mark so bloody on the business; but\\n    With colours fairer painted their foul ends.\\n    In few, they hurried us aboard a bark;\\n    Bore us some leagues to sea, where they prepared\\n    A rotten carcass of a butt, not rigg'd,\\n    Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats\\n    Instinctively have quit it. There they hoist us,\\n    To cry to th' sea, that roar'd to us; to sigh\\n    To th' winds, whose pity, sighing back again,\\n    Did us but loving wrong.\\n  MIRANDA. Alack, what trouble\\n    Was I then to you!\\n  PROSPERO. O, a cherubin\\n    Thou wast that did preserve me! Thou didst smile,\\n    Infused with a fortitude from heaven,\\n    When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,\\n    Under my burden groan'd; which rais'd in me\\n    An undergoing stomach, to bear up\\n    Against what should ensue.\\n  MIRANDA. How came we ashore?\\n  PROSPERO. By Providence divine.\\n    Some food we had and some fresh water that\\n    A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,\\n    Out of his charity, who being then appointed\\n    Master of this design, did give us, with\\n    Rich garments, linens, stuffs, and necessaries,\\n    Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,\\n    Knowing I lov'd my books, he furnish'd me\\n    From mine own library with volumes that\\n    I prize above my dukedom.\\n  MIRANDA. Would I might\\n    But ever see that man!\\n  PROSPERO. Now I arise.                    [Puts on his mantle]\\n    Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.\\n    Here in this island we arriv'd; and here\\n    Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit\\n    Than other princess' can, that have more time\\n    For vainer hours, and tutors not so careful.\\n  MIRANDA. Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you,\\n      sir,\\n    For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason\\n    For raising this sea-storm?\\n  PROSPERO. Know thus far forth:\\n    By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,\\n    Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies\\n    Brought to this shore; and by my prescience\\n    I find my zenith doth depend upon\\n    A most auspicious star, whose influence\\n    If now I court not, but omit, my fortunes\\n    Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions;\\n    Thou art inclin'd to sleep; 'tis a good dullness,\\n    And give it way. I know thou canst not choose.\\n                                                [MIRANDA sleeps]\\n    Come away, servant; come; I am ready now.\\n    Approach, my Ariel. Come.\\n\\n                        Enter ARIEL\\n\\n  ARIEL. All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come\\n    To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,\\n    To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride\\n    On the curl'd clouds. To thy strong bidding task\\n    Ariel and all his quality.\\n  PROSPERO. Hast thou, spirit,\\n    Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?\\n  ARIEL. To every article.\\n    I boarded the King's ship; now on the beak,\\n    Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,\\n    I flam'd amazement. Sometime I'd divide,\\n    And burn in many places; on the topmast,\\n    The yards, and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,\\n    Then meet and join Jove's lightning, the precursors\\n    O' th' dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary\\n    And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks\\n    Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune\\n    Seem to besiege, and make his bold waves tremble,\\n    Yea, his dread trident shake.\\n  PROSPERO. My brave spirit!\\n    Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil\\n    Would not infect his reason?\\n  ARIEL. Not a soul\\n    But felt a fever of the mad, and play'd\\n    Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners\\n    Plung'd in the foaming brine, and quit the vessel,\\n    Then all afire with me; the King's son, Ferdinand,\\n    With hair up-staring-then like reeds, not hair-\\n    Was the first man that leapt; cried 'Hell is empty,\\n    And all the devils are here.'\\n  PROSPERO. Why, that's my spirit!\\n    But was not this nigh shore?\\n  ARIEL. Close by, my master.\\n  PROSPERO. But are they, Ariel, safe?\\n  ARIEL. Not a hair perish'd;\\n    On their sustaining garments not a blemish,\\n    But fresher than before; and, as thou bad'st me,\\n    In troops I have dispers'd them 'bout the isle.\\n    The King's son have I landed by himself,\\n    Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs\\n    In an odd angle of the isle, and sitting,\\n    His arms in this sad knot.\\n  PROSPERO. Of the King's ship,\\n    The mariners, say how thou hast dispos'd,\\n    And all the rest o' th' fleet?\\n  ARIEL. Safely in harbour\\n    Is the King's ship; in the deep nook, where once\\n    Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew\\n    From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid;\\n    The mariners all under hatches stowed,\\n    Who, with a charm join'd to their suff'red labour,\\n    I have left asleep; and for the rest o' th' fleet,\\n    Which I dispers'd, they all have met again,\\n    And are upon the Mediterranean flote\\n    Bound sadly home for Naples,\\n    Supposing that they saw the King's ship wreck'd,\\n    And his great person perish.\\n  PROSPERO. Ariel, thy charge\\n    Exactly is perform'd; but there's more work.\\n    What is the time o' th' day?\\n  ARIEL. Past the mid season.\\n  PROSPERO. At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now\\n    Must by us both be spent most preciously.\\n  ARIEL. Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,\\n    Let me remember thee what thou hast promis'd,\\n    Which is not yet perform'd me.\\n  PROSPERO. How now, moody?\\n    What is't thou canst demand?\\n  ARIEL. My liberty.\\n  PROSPERO. Before the time be out? No more!\\n  ARIEL. I prithee,\\n    Remember I have done thee worthy service,\\n    Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, serv'd\\n    Without or grudge or grumblings. Thou didst promise\\n    To bate me a full year.\\n  PROSPERO. Dost thou forget\\n    From what a torment I did free thee?\\n  ARIEL. No.\\n  PROSPERO. Thou dost; and think'st it much to tread the ooze\\n    Of the salt deep,\\n    To run upon the sharp wind of the north,\\n    To do me business in the veins o' th' earth\\n    When it is bak'd with frost.\\n  ARIEL. I do not, sir.\\n  PROSPERO. Thou liest, malignant thing. Hast thou forgot\\n    The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy\\n    Was grown into a hoop? Hast thou forgot her?\\n  ARIEL. No, sir.\\n  PROSPERO. Thou hast. Where was she born?\\n    Speak; tell me.\\n  ARIEL. Sir, in Argier.\\n  PROSPERO. O, was she so? I must\\n    Once in a month recount what thou hast been,\\n    Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax,\\n    For mischiefs manifold, and sorceries terrible\\n    To enter human hearing, from Argier\\n    Thou know'st was banish'd; for one thing she did\\n    They would not take her life. Is not this true?\\n  ARIEL. Ay, sir.\\n  PROSPERO. This blue-ey'd hag was hither brought with child,\\n    And here was left by th'sailors. Thou, my slave,\\n    As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;\\n    And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate\\n    To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,\\n    Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,\\n    By help of her more potent ministers,\\n    And in her most unmitigable rage,\\n    Into a cloven pine; within which rift\\n    Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain\\n    A dozen years; within which space she died,\\n    And left thee there, where thou didst vent thy groans\\n    As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island-\\n    Save for the son that she did litter here,\\n    A freckl'd whelp, hag-born-not honour'd with\\n    A human shape.\\n  ARIEL. Yes, Caliban her son.\\n  PROSPERO. Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban\\n    Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st\\n    What torment I did find thee in; thy groans\\n    Did make wolves howl, and penetrate the breasts\\n    Of ever-angry bears; it was a torment\\n    To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax\\n    Could not again undo. It was mine art,\\n    When I arriv'd and heard thee, that made gape\\n    The pine, and let thee out.\\n  ARIEL. I thank thee, master.\\n  PROSPERO. If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak\\n    And peg thee in his knotty entrails, till\\n    Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters.\\n  ARIEL. Pardon, master;\\n    I will be correspondent to command,\\n    And do my spriting gently.\\n  PROSPERO. Do so; and after two days\\n    I will discharge thee.\\n  ARIEL. That's my noble master!\\n    What shall I do? Say what. What shall I do?\\n  PROSPERO. Go make thyself like a nymph o' th' sea; be subject\\n    To no sight but thine and mine, invisible\\n    To every eyeball else. Go take this shape,\\n    And hither come in 't. Go, hence with diligence!\\n                                                      Exit ARIEL\\n    Awake, dear heart, awake; thou hast slept well;\\n    Awake.\\n  MIRANDA. The strangeness of your story put\\n    Heaviness in me.\\n  PROSPERO. Shake it off. Come on,\\n    We'll visit Caliban, my slave, who never\\n    Yields us kind answer.\\n  MIRANDA. 'Tis a villain, sir,\\n    I do not love to look on.\\n  PROSPERO. But as 'tis,\\n    We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,\\n    Fetch in our wood, and serves in offices\\n    That profit us. What ho! slave! Caliban!\\n    Thou earth, thou! Speak.\\n  CALIBAN.   [ Within]  There's wood enough within.\\n  PROSPERO. Come forth, I say; there's other business for thee.\\n    Come, thou tortoise! when?\\n\\n             Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymph\\n\\n    Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,\\n    Hark in thine ear.\\n  ARIEL. My lord, it shall be done.                         Exit\\n  PROSPERO. Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself\\n    Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!\\n\\n                       Enter CALIBAN\\n\\n  CALIBAN. As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd\\n    With raven's feather from unwholesome fen\\n    Drop on you both! A south-west blow on ye\\n    And blister you all o'er!\\n  PROSPERO. For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,\\n    Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins\\n    Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,\\n    All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd\\n    As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging\\n    Than bees that made 'em.\\n  CALIBAN. I must eat my dinner.\\n    This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,\\n    Which thou tak'st from me. When thou cam'st first,\\n    Thou strok'st me and made much of me, wouldst give me\\n    Water with berries in't, and teach me how\\n    To name the bigger light, and how the less,\\n    That burn by day and night; and then I lov'd thee,\\n    And show'd thee all the qualities o' th' isle,\\n    The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile.\\n    Curs'd be I that did so! All the charms\\n    Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!\\n    For I am all the subjects that you have,\\n    Which first was mine own king; and here you sty me\\n    In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me\\n    The rest o' th' island.\\n  PROSPERO. Thou most lying slave,\\n    Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have us'd thee,\\n    Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodg'd thee\\n    In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate\\n    The honour of my child.\\n  CALIBAN. O ho, O ho! Would't had been done.\\n    Thou didst prevent me; I had peopl'd else\\n    This isle with Calibans.\\n  MIRANDA. Abhorred slave,\\n    Which any print of goodness wilt not take,\\n    Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,\\n    Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour\\n    One thing or other. When thou didst not, savage,\\n    Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like\\n    A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes\\n    With words that made them known. But thy vile race,\\n    Though thou didst learn, had that in't which good natures\\n    Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou\\n    Deservedly confin'd into this rock, who hadst\\n    Deserv'd more than a prison.\\n  CALIBAN. You taught me language, and my profit on't\\n    Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you\\n    For learning me your language!\\n  PROSPERO. Hag-seed, hence!\\n    Fetch us in fuel. And be quick, thou 'rt best,\\n    To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice?\\n    If thou neglect'st, or dost unwillingly\\n    What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,\\n    Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar,\\n    That beasts shall tremble at thy din.\\n  CALIBAN. No, pray thee.\\n    [Aside]  I must obey. His art is of such pow'r,\\n    It would control my dam's god, Setebos,\\n    And make a vassal of him.\\n  PROSPERO. So, slave; hence!                       Exit CALIBAN\\n\\n         Re-enter ARIEL invisible, playing ad singing;\\n                     FERDINAND following\\n\\n                          ARIEL'S SONG.\\n            Come unto these yellow sands,\\n              And then take hands;\\n            Curtsied when you have and kiss'd,\\n              The wild waves whist,\\n            Foot it featly here and there,\\n            And, sweet sprites, the burden bear.\\n              Hark, hark!\\n            [Burden dispersedly: Bow-wow.]\\n              The watch dogs bark.\\n            [Burden dispersedly: Bow-wow.]\\n              Hark, hark! I hear\\n            The strain of strutting chanticleer\\n              Cry, Cock-a-diddle-dow.\\n  FERDINAND. Where should this music be? I' th' air or th'\\n    earth?\\n    It sounds no more; and sure it waits upon\\n    Some god o' th' island. Sitting on a bank,\\n    Weeping again the King my father's wreck,\\n    This music crept by me upon the waters,\\n    Allaying both their fury and my passion\\n    With its sweet air; thence I have follow'd it,\\n    Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.\\n    No, it begins again.\\n\\n                   ARIEL'S SONG\\n         Full fathom five thy father lies;\\n           Of his bones are coral made;\\n         Those are pearls that were his eyes;\\n           Nothing of him that doth fade\\n         But doth suffer a sea-change\\n         Into something rich and strange.\\n         Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell:\\n           [Burden: Ding-dong.]\\n         Hark! now I hear them-Ding-dong bell.\\n\\n  FERDINAND. The ditty does remember my drown'd father.\\n    This is no mortal business, nor no sound\\n    That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.\\n  PROSPERO. The fringed curtains of thine eye advance,\\n    And say what thou seest yond.\\n  MIRANDA. What is't? a spirit?\\n    Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,\\n    It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.\\n  PROSPERO. No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses\\n    As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest\\n    Was in the wreck; and but he's something stain'd\\n    With grief, that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him\\n    A goodly person. He hath lost his fellows,\\n    And strays about to find 'em.\\n  MIRANDA. I might call him\\n    A thing divine; for nothing natural\\n    I ever saw so noble.\\n  PROSPERO.  [Aside]  It goes on, I see,\\n    As my soul prompts it. Spirit, fine spirit! I'll free thee\\n    Within two days for this.\\n  FERDINAND. Most sure, the goddess\\n    On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my pray'r\\n    May know if you remain upon this island;\\n    And that you will some good instruction give\\n    How I may bear me here. My prime request,\\n    Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!\\n    If you be maid or no?\\n  MIRANDA. No wonder, sir;\\n    But certainly a maid.\\n  FERDINAND. My language? Heavens!\\n    I am the best of them that speak this speech,\\n    Were I but where 'tis spoken.\\n  PROSPERO. How? the best?\\n    What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?\\n  FERDINAND. A single thing, as I am now, that wonders\\n    To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;\\n    And that he does I weep. Myself am Naples,\\n    Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld\\n    The King my father wreck'd.\\n  MIRANDA. Alack, for mercy!\\n  FERDINAND. Yes, faith, and all his lords, the Duke of Milan\\n    And his brave son being twain.\\n  PROSPERO.  [Aside]  The Duke of Milan\\n    And his more braver daughter could control thee,\\n    If now 'twere fit to do't. At the first sight\\n    They have chang'd eyes. Delicate Ariel,\\n    I'll set thee free for this.  [To FERDINAND]  A word, good\\n    sir;\\n    I fear you have done yourself some wrong; a word.\\n  MIRANDA. Why speaks my father so ungently? This\\n    Is the third man that e'er I saw; the first\\n    That e'er I sigh'd for. Pity move my father\\n    To be inclin'd my way!\\n  FERDINAND. O, if a virgin,\\n    And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you\\n    The Queen of Naples.\\n  PROSPERO. Soft, Sir! one word more.\\n    [Aside]  They are both in either's pow'rs; but this swift\\n    busines\\n    I must uneasy make, lest too light winning\\n    Make the prize light.  [To FERDINAND]  One word more; I\\n    charge thee\\n    That thou attend me; thou dost here usurp\\n    The name thou ow'st not; and hast put thyself\\n    Upon this island as a spy, to win it\\n    From me, the lord on't.\\n  FERDINAND. No, as I am a man.\\n  MIRANDA. There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple.\\n    If the ill spirit have so fair a house,\\n    Good things will strive to dwell with't.\\n  PROSPERO. Follow me.\\n    Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come;\\n    I'll manacle thy neck and feet together.\\n    Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be\\n    The fresh-brook mussels, wither'd roots, and husks\\n    Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.\\n  FERDINAND. No;\\n    I will resist such entertainment till\\n    Mine enemy has more power.\\n                          [He draws, and is charmed from moving]\\n  MIRANDA. O dear father,\\n    Make not too rash a trial of him, for\\n    He's gentle, and not fearful.\\n  PROSPERO. What, I say,\\n    My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor;\\n    Who mak'st a show but dar'st not strike, thy conscience\\n    Is so possess'd with guilt. Come from thy ward;\\n    For I can here disarm thee with this stick\\n    And make thy weapon drop.\\n  MIRANDA. Beseech you, father!\\n  PROSPERO. Hence! Hang not on my garments.\\n  MIRANDA. Sir, have pity;\\n    I'll be his surety.\\n  PROSPERO. Silence! One word more\\n    Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!\\n    An advocate for an impostor! hush!\\n    Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,\\n    Having seen but him and Caliban. Foolish wench!\\n    To th' most of men this is a Caliban,\\n    And they to him are angels.\\n  MIRANDA. My affections\\n    Are then most humble; I have no ambition\\n    To see a goodlier man.\\n  PROSPERO. Come on; obey.\\n    Thy nerves are in their infancy again,\\n    And have no vigour in them.\\n  FERDINAND. So they are;\\n    My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.\\n    My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,\\n    The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats\\n    To whom I am subdu'd, are but light to me,\\n    Might I but through my prison once a day\\n    Behold this maid. All corners else o' th' earth\\n    Let liberty make use of; space enough\\n    Have I in such a prison.\\n  PROSPERO.  [Aside]  It works.  [To FERDINAND]  Come on.-\\n    Thou hast done well, fine Ariel!  [To FERDINAND]  Follow\\n    me.\\n    [To ARIEL]  Hark what thou else shalt do me.\\n  MIRANDA. Be of comfort;\\n    My father's of a better nature, sir,\\n    Than he appears by speech; this is unwonted\\n    Which now came from him.\\n  PROSPERO.  [To ARIEL]  Thou shalt be as free\\n    As mountain winds; but then exactly do\\n    All points of my command.\\n  ARIEL. To th' syllable.\\n  PROSPERO.  [To FERDINAND]  Come, follow.  [To MIRANDA]\\n    Speak not for him.

       " \"\\n\\nAnother part of the island\\n\\nEnter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and\\nOTHERS\\n\\n  GONZALO. Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,\\n    So have we all, of joy; for our escape\\n    Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe\\n    Is common; every day, some sailor's wife,\\n    The masters of some merchant, and the merchant,\\n    Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,\\n    I mean our preservation, few in millions\\n    Can speak like us. Then wisely, good sir, weigh\\n    Our sorrow with our comfort.\\n  ALONSO. Prithee, peace.\\n  SEBASTIAN. He receives comfort like cold porridge.\\n  ANTONIO. The visitor will not give him o'er so.\\n  SEBASTIAN. Look, he's winding up the watch of his wit; by\\n    and by it will strike.\\n  GONZALO. Sir-\\n  SEBASTIAN. One-Tell.\\n  GONZALO. When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,\\n    Comes to th' entertainer-\\n  SEBASTIAN. A dollar.\\n  GONZALO. Dolour comes to him, indeed; you have spoken\\n    truer than you purpos'd.\\n  SEBASTIAN. You have taken it wiselier than I meant you\\n    should.\\n  GONZALO. Therefore, my lord-\\n  ANTONIO. Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!\\n  ALONSO. I prithee, spare.\\n  GONZALO. Well, I have done; but yet-\\n  SEBASTIAN. He will be talking.\\n  ANTONIO. Which, of he or Adrian, for a good wager, first\\n    begins to crow?\\n  SEBASTIAN. The old cock.\\n  ANTONIO. The cock'rel.\\n  SEBASTIAN. Done. The wager?\\n  ANTONIO. A laughter.\\n  SEBASTIAN. A match!\\n  ADRIAN. Though this island seem to be desert-\\n  ANTONIO. Ha, ha, ha!\\n  SEBASTIAN. So, you're paid.\\n  ADRIAN. Uninhabitable, and almost inaccessible-\\n  SEBASTIAN. Yet-\\n  ADRIAN. Yet-\\n  ANTONIO. He could not miss't.\\n  ADRIAN. It must needs be of subtle, tender, and delicate\\n    temperance.\\n  ANTONIO. Temperance was a delicate wench.\\n  SEBASTIAN. Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly\\n    deliver'd.\\n  ADRIAN. The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.\\n  SEBASTIAN. As if it had lungs, and rotten ones.\\n  ANTONIO. Or, as 'twere perfum'd by a fen.\\n  GONZALO. Here is everything advantageous to life.\\n  ANTONIO. True; save means to live.\\n  SEBASTIAN. Of that there's none, or little.\\n  GONZALO. How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!\\n  ANTONIO. The ground indeed is tawny.\\n  SEBASTIAN. With an eye of green in't.\\n  ANTONIO. He misses not much.\\n  SEBASTIAN. No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.\\n  GONZALO. But the rarity of it is, which is indeed almost\\n    beyond credit-\\n  SEBASTIAN. As many vouch'd rarities are.\\n  GONZALO. That our garments, being, as they were, drench'd\\n    in the sea, hold, notwithstanding, their freshness and\\n    glosses, being rather new-dy'd, than stain'd with salt\\n    water.\\n  ANTONIO. If but one of his pockets could speak, would it\\n    not say he lies?\\n  SEBASTIAN. Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.\\n  GONZALO. Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when\\n    we put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of the\\n    King's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.\\n  SEBASTIAN. 'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in\\n    our return.\\n  ADRIAN. Tunis was never grac'd before with such a paragon\\n    to their queen.\\n  GONZALO. Not since widow Dido's time.\\n  ANTONIO. Widow! a pox o' that! How came that 'widow'\\n    in? Widow Dido!\\n  SEBASTIAN. What if he had said 'widower Aeneas' too?\\n    Good Lord, how you take it!\\n  ADRIAN. 'Widow Dido' said you? You make me study of\\n    that. She was of Carthage, not of Tunis.\\n  GONZALO. This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.\\n  ADRIAN. Carthage?\\n  GONZALO. I assure you, Carthage.\\n  ANTONIO. His word is more than the miraculous harp.\\n  SEBASTIAN. He hath rais'd the wall, and houses too.\\n  ANTONIO. What impossible matter will he make easy next?\\n  SEBASTIAN. I think he will carry this island home in his\\n    pocket, and give it his son for an apple.\\n  ANTONIO. And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring\\n    forth more islands.\\n  GONZALO. Ay.\\n  ANTONIO. Why, in good time.\\n  GONZALO. Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now\\n    as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of\\n    your daughter, who is now Queen.\\n  ANTONIO. And the rarest that e'er came there.\\n  SEBASTIAN. Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.\\n  ANTONIO. O, widow Dido! Ay, widow Dido.\\n  GONZALO. Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I\\n    wore it? I mean, in a sort.\\n  ANTONIO. That 'sort' was well fish'd for.\\n  GONZALO. When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?\\n  ALONSO. You cram these words into mine ears against\\n    The stomach of my sense. Would I had never\\n    Married my daughter there; for, coming thence,\\n    My son is lost; and, in my rate, she too,\\n    Who is so far from Italy removed\\n    I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir\\n    Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish\\n    Hath made his meal on thee?\\n  FRANCISCO. Sir, he may live;\\n    I saw him beat the surges under him,\\n    And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,\\n    Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted\\n    The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head\\n    'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oared\\n    Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke\\n    To th' shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bowed,\\n    As stooping to relieve him. I not doubt\\n    He came alive to land.\\n  ALONSO. No, no, he's gone.\\n  SEBASTIAN. Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,\\n    That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,\\n    But rather lose her to an African;\\n    Where she, at least, is banish'd from your eye,\\n    Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.\\n  ALONSO. Prithee, peace.\\n  SEBASTIAN. You were kneel'd to, and importun'd otherwise\\n    By all of us; and the fair soul herself\\n    Weigh'd between loathness and obedience at\\n    Which end o' th' beam should bow. We have lost your son,\\n    I fear, for ever. Milan and Naples have\\n    Moe widows in them of this business' making,\\n    Than we bring men to comfort them;\\n    The fault's your own.\\n  ALONSO. So is the dear'st o' th' loss.\\n  GONZALO. My lord Sebastian,\\n    The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness,\\n    And time to speak it in; you rub the sore,\\n    When you should bring the plaster.\\n  SEBASTIAN. Very well.\\n  ANTONIO. And most chirurgeonly.\\n  GONZALO. It is foul weather in us all, good sir,\\n    When you are cloudy.\\n  SEBASTIAN. Foul weather?\\n  ANTONIO. Very foul.\\n  GONZALO. Had I plantation of this isle, my lord-\\n  ANTONIO. He'd sow 't with nettle-seed.\\n  SEBASTIAN. Or docks, or mallows.\\n  GONZALO. And were the king on't, what would I do?\\n  SEBASTIAN. Scape being drunk for want of wine.\\n  GONZALO. I' th' commonwealth I would by contraries\\n    Execute all things; for no kind of traffic\\n    Would I admit; no name of magistrate;\\n    Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,\\n    And use of service, none; contract, succession,\\n    Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;\\n    No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;\\n    No occupation; all men idle, all;\\n    And women too, but innocent and pure;\\n    No sovereignty-\\n  SEBASTIAN. Yet he would be king on't.\\n  ANTONIO. The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the\\n    beginning.\\n  GONZALO. All things in common nature should produce\\n    Without sweat or endeavour. Treason, felony,\\n    Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,\\n    Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,\\n    Of it own kind, all foison, all abundance,\\n    To feed my innocent people.\\n  SEBASTIAN. No marrying 'mong his subjects?\\n  ANTONIO. None, man; all idle; whores and knaves.\\n  GONZALO. I would with such perfection govern, sir,\\n    T' excel the golden age.\\n  SEBASTIAN. Save his Majesty!\\n  ANTONIO. Long live Gonzalo!\\n  GONZALO. And-do you mark me, sir?\\n  ALONSO. Prithee, no more; thou dost talk nothing to me.\\n  GONZALO. I do well believe your Highness; and did it to\\n    minister occasion to these gentlemen, who are of such\\n    sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh\\n    at nothing.\\n  ANTONIO. 'Twas you we laugh'd at.\\n  GONZALO. Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to\\n    you; so you may continue, and laugh at nothing still.\\n  ANTONIO. What a blow was there given!\\n  SEBASTIAN. An it had not fall'n flat-long.\\n  GONZALO. You are gentlemen of brave mettle; you would\\n    lift the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue\\n    in it five weeks without changing.\\n\\n          Enter ARIEL, invisible, playing solemn music\\n\\n  SEBASTIAN. We would so, and then go a-bat-fowling.\\n  ANTONIO. Nay, good my lord, be not angry.\\n  GONZALO. No, I warrant you; I will not adventure my\\n    discretion so weakly. Will you laugh me asleep, for I am\\n    very heavy?\\n  ANTONIO. Go sleep, and hear us.\\n                   [All sleep but ALONSO, SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO]\\n  ALONSO. What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes\\n    Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts; I find\\n    They are inclin'd to do so.\\n  SEBASTIAN. Please you, sir,\\n    Do not omit the heavy offer of it:\\n    It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,\\n    It is a comforter.\\n  ANTONIO. We two, my lord,\\n    Will guard your person while you take your rest,\\n    And watch your safety.\\n  ALONSO. Thank you-wondrous heavy!\\n                                     [ALONSO sleeps. Exit ARIEL]\\n  SEBASTIAN. What a strange drowsiness possesses them!\\n  ANTONIO. It is the quality o' th' climate.\\n  SEBASTIAN. Why\\n    Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not\\n    Myself dispos'd to sleep.\\n  ANTONIO. Nor I; my spirits are nimble.\\n    They fell together all, as by consent;\\n    They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,\\n    Worthy Sebastian? O, what might! No more!\\n    And yet methinks I see it in thy face,\\n    What thou shouldst be; th' occasion speaks thee; and\\n    My strong imagination sees a crown\\n    Dropping upon thy head.\\n  SEBASTIAN. What, art thou waking?\\n  ANTONIO. Do you not hear me speak?\\n  SEBASTIAN. I do; and surely\\n    It is a sleepy language, and thou speak'st\\n    Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?\\n    This is a strange repose, to be asleep\\n    With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,\\n    And yet so fast asleep.\\n  ANTONIO. Noble Sebastian,\\n    Thou let'st thy fortune sleep-die rather; wink'st\\n    Whiles thou art waking.\\n  SEBASTIAN. Thou dost snore distinctly;\\n    There's meaning in thy snores.\\n  ANTONIO. I am more serious than my custom; you\\n    Must be so too, if heed me; which to do\\n    Trebles thee o'er.\\n  SEBASTIAN. Well, I am standing water.\\n  ANTONIO. I'll teach you how to flow.\\n  SEBASTIAN. Do so: to ebb,\\n    Hereditary sloth instructs me.\\n  ANTONIO. O,\\n    If you but knew how you the purpose cherish,\\n    Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,\\n    You more invest it! Ebbing men indeed,\\n    Most often, do so near the bottom run\\n    By their own fear or sloth.\\n  SEBASTIAN. Prithee say on.\\n    The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim\\n    A matter from thee; and a birth, indeed,\\n    Which throes thee much to yield.\\n  ANTONIO. Thus, sir:\\n    Although this lord of weak remembrance, this\\n    Who shall be of as little memory\\n    When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuaded-\\n    For he's a spirit of persuasion, only\\n    Professes to persuade-the King his son's alive,\\n    'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd\\n    As he that sleeps here swims.\\n  SEBASTIAN. I have no hope\\n    That he's undrown'd.\\n  ANTONIO. O, out of that 'no hope'\\n    What great hope have you! No hope that way is\\n    Another way so high a hope, that even\\n    Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,\\n    But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me\\n    That Ferdinand is drown'd?\\n  SEBASTIAN. He's gone.\\n  ANTONIO. Then tell me,\\n    Who's the next heir of Naples?\\n  SEBASTIAN. Claribel.\\n  ANTONIO. She that is Queen of Tunis; she that dwells\\n    Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from Naples\\n    Can have no note, unless the sun were post,\\n    The Man i' th' Moon's too slow, till newborn chins\\n    Be rough and razorable; she that from whom\\n    We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again,\\n    And by that destiny, to perform an act\\n    Whereof what's past is prologue, what to come\\n    In yours and my discharge.\\n  SEBASTIAN. What stuff is this! How say you?\\n    'Tis true, my brother's daughter's Queen of Tunis;\\n    So is she heir of Naples; 'twixt which regions\\n    There is some space.\\n  ANTONIO. A space whose ev'ry cubit\\n    Seems to cry out 'How shall that Claribel\\n    Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,\\n    And let Sebastian wake.' Say this were death\\n    That now hath seiz'd them; why, they were no worse\\n    Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples\\n    As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate\\n    As amply and unnecessarily\\n    As this Gonzalo; I myself could make\\n    A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore\\n    The mind that I do! What a sleep were this\\n    For your advancement! Do you understand me?\\n  SEBASTIAN. Methinks I do.\\n  ANTONIO. And how does your content\\n    Tender your own good fortune?\\n  SEBASTIAN. I remember\\n    You did supplant your brother Prospero.\\n  ANTONIO. True.\\n    And look how well my garments sit upon me,\\n    Much feater than before. My brother's servants\\n    Were then my fellows; now they are my men.\\n  SEBASTIAN. But, for your conscience-\\n  ANTONIO. Ay, sir; where lies that? If 'twere a kibe,\\n    'Twould put me to my slipper; but I feel not\\n    This deity in my bosom; twenty consciences\\n    That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be they\\n    And melt, ere they molest! Here lies your brother,\\n    No better than the earth he lies upon,\\n    If he were that which now he's like-that's dead;\\n    Whom I with this obedient steel, three inches of it,\\n    Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,\\n    To the perpetual wink for aye might put\\n    This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who\\n    Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,\\n    They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;\\n    They'll tell the clock to any business that\\n    We say befits the hour.\\n  SEBASTIAN. Thy case, dear friend,\\n    Shall be my precedent; as thou got'st Milan,\\n    I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword. One stroke\\n    Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;\\n    And I the King shall love thee.\\n  ANTONIO. Draw together;\\n    And when I rear my hand, do you the like,\\n    To fall it on Gonzalo.\\n  SEBASTIAN. O, but one word.                  [They talk apart]\\n\\n          Re-enter ARIEL, invisible, with music and song\\n\\n  ARIEL. My master through his art foresees the danger\\n    That you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth-\\n    For else his project dies-to keep them living.\\n                                        [Sings in GONZALO'S ear]\\n    While you here do snoring lie,\\n    Open-ey'd conspiracy\\n    His time doth take.\\n    If of life you keep a care,\\n    Shake off slumber, and beware.\\n    Awake, awake!\\n\\n  ANTONIO. Then let us both be sudden.\\n  GONZALO. Now, good angels\\n    Preserve the King!                               [They wake]\\n  ALONSO. Why, how now?-Ho, awake!-Why are you drawn?\\n    Wherefore this ghastly looking?\\n  GONZALO. What's the matter?\\n  SEBASTIAN. Whiles we stood here securing your repose,\\n    Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing\\n    Like bulls, or rather lions; did't not wake you?\\n    It struck mine ear most terribly.\\n  ALONSO. I heard nothing.\\n  ANTONIO. O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,\\n    To make an earthquake! Sure it was the roar\\n    Of a whole herd of lions.\\n  ALONSO. Heard you this, Gonzalo?\\n  GONZALO. Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,\\n    And that a strange one too, which did awake me;\\n    I shak'd you, sir, and cried; as mine eyes open'd,\\n    I saw their weapons drawn-there was a noise,\\n    That's verily. 'Tis best we stand upon our guard,\\n    Or that we quit this place. Let's draw our weapons.\\n  ALONSO. Lead off this ground; and let's make further\\n    search\\n    For my poor son.\\n  GONZALO.

       " \"\\n\\nAnother part of the island\\n\\nEnter CALIBAN, with a burden of wood. A noise of thunder heard\\n\\n  CALIBAN. All the infections that the sun sucks up\\n    From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall, and make him\\n    By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me,\\n    And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch,\\n    Fright me with urchin-shows, pitch me i' th' mire,\\n    Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark\\n    Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but\\n    For every trifle are they set upon me;\\n    Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me,\\n    And after bite me; then like hedgehogs which\\n    Lie tumbling in my barefoot way, and mount\\n    Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I\\n    All wound with adders, who with cloven tongues\\n    Do hiss me into madness.\\n\\n                         Enter TRINCULO\\n\\n    Lo, now, lo!\\n    Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me\\n    For bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat;\\n    Perchance he will not mind me.\\n  TRINCULO. Here's neither bush nor shrub to bear off any\\n    weather at all, and another storm brewing; I hear it\\n    sing i' th' wind. Yond same black cloud, yond huge one,\\n    looks like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor. If\\n    it should thunder as it did before, I know not where to\\n    hide my head. Yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by\\n    pailfuls. What have we here? a man or a fish? dead or\\n    alive? A fish: he smells like a fish; a very ancient and\\n    fish-like smell; kind of not-of-the-newest Poor-John. A\\n    strange fish! Were I in England now, as once I was, and\\n    had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but\\n    would give a piece of silver. There would this monster\\n    make a man; any strange beast there makes a man; when\\n    they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they\\n    will lay out ten to see a dead Indian. Legg'd like a\\n    man, and his fins like arms! Warm, o' my troth! I do now\\n    let loose my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no\\n    fish, but an islander, that hath lately suffered by\\n    thunderbolt.  [Thunder]  Alas, the storm is come again! My\\n    best way is to creep under his gaberdine; there is no\\n    other shelter hereabout. Misery acquaints a man with\\n    strange bed-fellows.

Do not torment me. O!\\n  STEPHANO. What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you\\n    put tricks upon 's with savages and men of Ind? Ha! I\\n    have not scap'd drowning to be afeard now of your four\\n    legs; for it hath been said: As proper a man as ever\\n    went on four legs cannot make him give ground; and it\\n    shall be said so again, while Stephano breathes at\\n    nostrils.\\n  CALIBAN. The spirit torments me. O!\\n  STEPHANO. This is some monster of the isle with four legs,\\n    who hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil\\n    should he learn our language? I will give him some\\n    relief, if it be but for that. If I can recover him, and\\n    keep him tame, and get to Naples with him, he's a\\n    present for any emperor that ever trod on neat's\\n    leather.\\n  CALIBAN. Do not torment me, prithee; I'll bring my wood\\n    home faster.\\n  STEPHANO. He's in his fit now, and does not talk after the\\n    wisest. He shall taste of my bottle; if he have never\\n    drunk wine afore, it will go near to remove his fit. If\\n    I can recover him, and keep him tame, I will not take\\n    too much for him; he shall pay for him that hath him,\\n    and that soundly.\\n  CALIBAN. Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon,\\n    I know it by thy trembling; now Prosper works upon thee.\\n  STEPHANO. Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is\\n    that which will give language to you, cat. Open your\\n    mouth; this will shake your shaking, I can tell you, and\\n    that soundly; you cannot tell who's your friend. Open\\n    your chaps again.\\n  TRINCULO. I should know that voice; it should be-but he is\\n    drown'd; and these are devils. O, defend me!\\n  STEPHANO. Four legs and two voices; a most delicate monster!\\n    His forward voice, now, is to speak well of his\\n    friend; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches and\\n    to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will recover\\n    him, I will help his ague. Come-Amen! I will pour some\\n    in thy other mouth.\\n  TRINCULO. Stephano!\\n  STEPHANO. Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy!\\n    This is a devil, and no monster; I will leave him; I\\n    have no long spoon.\\n  TRINCULO. Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me, and\\n    speak to me; for I am Trinculo-be not afeard-thy good\\n    friend Trinculo.\\n  STEPHANO. If thou beest Trinculo, come forth; I'll pull\\n    the by the lesser legs; if any be Trinculo's legs, these\\n    are they. Thou art very Trinculo indeed! How cam'st thou\\n    to be the siege of this moon-calf? Can he vent\\n    Trinculos?\\n  TRINCULO. I took him to be kill'd with a thunderstroke.\\n    But art thou not drown'd, Stephano? I hope now thou are\\n    not drown'd. Is the storm overblown? I hid me under the\\n    dead moon-calf's gaberdine for fear of the storm. And\\n    art thou living, Stephano? O Stephano, two Neapolitans\\n    scap'd!\\n  STEPHANO. Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not\\n    constant.\\n  CALIBAN.

How cam'st thou hither?\\n    Swear by this bottle how thou cam'st hither-I escap'd\\n    upon a butt of sack, which the sailors heaved o'erboard-\\n    by this bottle, which I made of the bark of a tree, with\\n    mine own hands, since I was cast ashore.\\n  CALIBAN. I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true\\n    subject, for the liquor is not earthly.\\n  STEPHANO. Here; swear then how thou escap'dst.\\n  TRINCULO. Swum ashore, man, like a duck; I can swim like\\n    a duck, I'll be sworn.\\n  STEPHANO.  [Passing the bottle]  Here, kiss the book. Though\\n    thou canst swim like a duck, thou art made like a\\n    goose.\\n  TRINCULO. O Stephano, hast any more of this?\\n  STEPHANO. The whole butt, man; my cellar is in a rock by\\n    th' seaside, where my wine is hid. How now, moon-calf!\\n    How does thine ague?\\n  CALIBAN. Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven?\\n  STEPHANO. Out o' th' moon, I do assure thee; I was the Man\\n    i' th' Moon, when time was.\\n  CALIBAN. I have seen thee in her, and I do adore thee.

I'll show thee the best springs; I'll pluck thee\\n    berries;\\n    I'll fish for thee, and get thee wood enough.\\n    A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!\\n    I'll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,\\n    Thou wondrous man.\\n  TRINCULO.

Wilt thou go with me?\\n  STEPHANO. I prithee now, lead the way without any more\\n    talking. Trinculo, the King and all our company else\\n    being drown'd, we will inherit here. Here, bear my bottle.\\n    Fellow Trinculo, we'll fill him by and by again.\\n  CALIBAN.  [Sings drunkenly]  Farewell, master; farewell,\\n    farewell!\\n  TRINCULO.

There be some sports are painful, and their\\n    labour\\n    Delight in them sets off; some kinds of baseness\\n    Are nobly undergone, and most poor matters\\n    Point to rich ends. This my mean task\\n    Would be as heavy to me as odious, but\\n    The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead,\\n    And makes my labours pleasures. O, she is\\n    Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed;\\n    And he's compos'd of harshness. I must remove\\n    Some thousands of these logs, and pile them up,\\n    Upon a sore injunction; my sweet mistress\\n    Weeps when she sees me work, and says such baseness\\n    Had never like executor. I forget;\\n    But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,\\n    Most busy, least when I do it.\\n\\n        Enter MIRANDA; and PROSPERO at a distance, unseen\\n\\n  MIRANDA. Alas, now; pray you,\\n    Work not so hard; I would the lightning had\\n    Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile.\\n    Pray, set it down and rest you; when this burns,\\n    'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father\\n    Is hard at study; pray, now, rest yourself;\\n    He's safe for these three hours.\\n  FERDINAND. O most dear mistress,\\n    The sun will set before I shall discharge\\n    What I must strive to do.\\n  MIRANDA. If you'll sit down,\\n    I'll bear your logs the while; pray give me that;\\n    I'll carry it to the pile.\\n  FERDINAND. No, precious creature;\\n    I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,\\n    Than you should such dishonour undergo,\\n    While I sit lazy by.\\n  MIRANDA. It would become me\\n    As well as it does you; and I should do it\\n    With much more ease; for my good will is to it,\\n    And yours it is against.\\n  PROSPERO.  [Aside]  Poor worm, thou art infected!\\n    This visitation shows it.\\n  MIRANDA. You look wearily.\\n  FERDINAND. No, noble mistress; 'tis fresh morning with me\\n    When you are by at night. I do beseech you,\\n    Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers,\\n    What is your name?\\n  MIRANDA. Miranda-O my father,\\n    I have broke your hest to say so!\\n  FERDINAND. Admir'd Miranda!\\n    What's dearest to the world! Full many a lady\\n    I have ey'd with best regard; and many a time\\n    Th' harmony of their tongues hath into bondage\\n    Brought my too diligent ear; for several virtues\\n    Have I lik'd several women, never any\\n    With so full soul, but some defect in her\\n    Did quarrel with the noblest grace she ow'd,\\n    And put it to the foil; but you, O you,\\n    So perfect and so peerless, are created\\n    Of every creature's best!\\n  MIRANDA. I do not know\\n    One of my sex; no woman's face remember,\\n    Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen\\n    More that I may call men than you, good friend,\\n    And my dear father. How features are abroad,\\n    I am skilless of; but, by my modesty,\\n    The jewel in my dower, I would not wish\\n    Any companion in the world but you;\\n    Nor can imagination form a shape,\\n    Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle\\n    Something too wildly, and my father's precepts\\n    I therein do forget.\\n  FERDINAND. I am, in my condition,\\n    A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king-\\n    I would not so!-and would no more endure\\n    This wooden slavery than to suffer\\n    The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:\\n    The very instant that I saw you, did\\n    My heart fly to your service; there resides\\n    To make me slave to it; and for your sake\\n    Am I this patient log-man.\\n  MIRANDA. Do you love me?\\n  FERDINAND. O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound,\\n    And crown what I profess with kind event,\\n    If I speak true! If hollowly, invert\\n    What best is boded me to mischief! I,\\n    Beyond all limit of what else i' th' world,\\n    Do love, prize, honour you.\\n  MIRANDA. I am a fool\\n    To weep at what I am glad of.\\n  PROSPERO.  [Aside]  Fair encounter\\n    Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace\\n    On that which breeds between 'em!\\n  FERDINAND. Wherefore weep you?\\n  MIRANDA. At mine unworthiness, that dare not offer\\n    What I desire to give, and much less take\\n    What I shall die to want. But this is trifling;\\n    And all the more it seeks to hide itself,\\n    The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!\\n    And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!\\n    I am your wife, if you will marry me;\\n    If not, I'll die your maid. To be your fellow\\n    You may deny me; but I'll be your servant,\\n    Whether you will or no.\\n  FERDINAND. My mistress, dearest;\\n    And I thus humble ever.\\n  MIRANDA.

He were a brave\\n    monster indeed, if they were set in his tail.\\n  STEPHANO. My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in\\n    sack. For my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere\\n    I could recover the shore, five and thirty leagues, off\\n    and on. By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant,\\n    monster, or my standard.\\n  TRINCULO. Your lieutenant, if you list; he's no standard.\\n  STEPHANO. We'll not run, Monsieur Monster.\\n  TRINCULO.

Let me lick thy shoe.\\n    I'll not serve him; he is not valiant.\\n  TRINCULO. Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case\\n    to justle a constable.

That's most certain.\\n  CALIBAN. Thou shalt be lord of it, and I'll serve thee.\\n  STEPHANO. How now shall this be compass'd? Canst thou\\n    bring me to the party?\\n  CALIBAN. Yea, yea, my lord; I'll yield him thee asleep,\\n    Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head.\\n  ARIEL. Thou liest; thou canst not.\\n  CALIBAN. What a pied ninny's this! Thou scurvy patch!\\n    I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows,\\n    And take his bottle from him. When that's gone\\n    He shall drink nought but brine; for I'll not show him\\n    Where the quick freshes are.\\n  STEPHANO. Trinculo, run into no further danger; interrupt\\n    the monster one word further and, by this hand, I'll turn\\n    my mercy out o' doors, and make a stock-fish of thee.\\n  TRINCULO. Why, what did I? I did nothing. I'll go farther\\n    off.\\n  STEPHANO. Didst thou not say he lied?\\n  ARIEL. Thou liest.\\n  STEPHANO. Do I so? Take thou that.  [Beats him]  As you like\\n    this, give me the lie another time.\\n  TRINCULO. I did not give the lie. Out o' your wits and\\n    hearing too? A pox o' your bottle! This can sack and\\n    drinking do. A murrain on your monster, and the devil\\n    take your fingers!\\n  CALIBAN. Ha, ha, ha!\\n  STEPHANO. Now, forward with your tale.-Prithee stand\\n    further off.\\n  CALIBAN. Beat him enough; after a little time, I'll beat\\n    him too.\\n  STEPHANO. Stand farther. Come, proceed.\\n  CALIBAN. Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him\\n    I' th' afternoon to sleep; there thou mayst brain him,\\n    Having first seiz'd his books; or with a log\\n    Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,\\n    Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember\\n    First to possess his books; for without them\\n    He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not\\n    One spirit to command; they all do hate him\\n    As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.\\n    He has brave utensils-for so he calls them-\\n    Which, when he has a house, he'll deck withal.\\n    And that most deeply to consider is\\n    The beauty of his daughter; he himself\\n    Calls her a nonpareil. I never saw a woman\\n    But only Sycorax my dam and she;\\n    But she as far surpasseth Sycorax\\n    As great'st does least.\\n  STEPHANO. Is it so brave a lass?\\n  CALIBAN. Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant,\\n    And bring thee forth brave brood.\\n  STEPHANO. Monster, I will kill this man; his daughter and I\\n    will be King and Queen-save our Graces!-and Trinculo\\n    and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou like the plot,\\n    Trinculo?\\n  TRINCULO. Excellent.\\n  STEPHANO. Give me thy hand; I am sorry I beat thee; but\\n    while thou liv'st, keep a good tongue in thy head.\\n  CALIBAN. Within this half hour will he be asleep.\\n    Wilt thou destroy him then?\\n  STEPHANO. Ay, on mine honour.\\n  ARIEL. This will I tell my master.\\n  CALIBAN. Thou mak'st me merry; I am full of pleasure.\\n    Let us be jocund; will you troll the catch\\n    You taught me but while-ere?\\n  STEPHANO. At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any\\n    reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.              [Sings]\\n\\n    Flout 'em and scout 'em,\\n    And scout 'em and flout 'em;\\n    Thought is free.\\n\\n  CALIBAN. That's not the tune.\\n                      [ARIEL plays the tune on a tabor and pipe]\\n  STEPHANO. What is this same?\\n  TRINCULO. This is the tune of our catch, play'd by the\\n    picture of Nobody.\\n  STEPHANO. If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy\\n    likeness; if thou beest a devil, take't as thou list.\\n  TRINCULO. O, forgive me my sins!\\n  STEPHANO. He that dies pays all debts. I defy thee. Mercy\\n    upon us!\\n  CALIBAN. Art thou afeard?\\n  STEPHANO. No, monster, not I.\\n  CALIBAN. Be not afeard. The isle is full of noises,\\n    Sounds, and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not.\\n    Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments\\n    Will hum about mine ears; and sometimes voices,\\n    That, if I then had wak'd after long sleep,\\n    Will make me sleep again; and then, in dreaming,\\n    The clouds methought would open and show riches\\n    Ready to drop upon me, that, when I wak'd,\\n    I cried to dream again.\\n  STEPHANO. This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I\\n    shall have my music for nothing.\\n  CALIBAN. When Prospero is destroy'd.\\n  STEPHANO. That shall be by and by; I remember the story.\\n  TRINCULO. The sound is going away; let's follow it, and\\n    after do our work.\\n  STEPHANO. Lead, monster; we'll follow.

Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas\\n    Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats, and pease;\\n    Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,\\n    And flat meads thatch'd with stover, them to keep;\\n    Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,\\n    Which spongy April at thy hest betrims,\\n    To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom groves,\\n    Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,\\n    Being lass-lorn; thy pole-clipt vineyard;\\n    And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky hard,\\n    Where thou thyself dost air-the Queen o' th' sky,\\n    Whose wat'ry arch and messenger am I,\\n    Bids thee leave these; and with her sovereign grace,\\n    Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,\\n    To come and sport.

A contract of true love to celebrate,\\n    And some donation freely to estate\\n    On the blest lovers.\\n  CERES. Tell me, heavenly bow,\\n    If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,\\n    Do now attend the Queen? Since they did plot\\n    The means that dusky Dis my daughter got,\\n    Her and her blind boy's scandal'd company\\n    I have forsworn.\\n  IRIS. Of her society\\n    Be not afraid. I met her Deity\\n    Cutting the clouds towards Paphos, and her son\\n    Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have done\\n    Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,\\n    Whose vows are that no bed-rite shall be paid\\n    Till Hymen's torch be lighted; but in vain.\\n    Mars's hot minion is return'd again;\\n    Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,\\n    Swears he will shoot no more, but play with sparrows,\\n    And be a boy right out.                       [JUNO alights]\\n  CERES. Highest Queen of State,\\n    Great Juno, comes; I know her by her gait.\\n  JUNO. How does my bounteous sister?

This is a most majestic vision, and\\n    Harmonious charmingly. May I be bold\\n    To think these spirits?\\n  PROSPERO. Spirits, which by mine art\\n    I have from their confines call'd to enact\\n    My present fancies.\\n  FERDINAND. Let me live here ever;\\n    So rare a wond'red father and a wise\\n    Makes this place Paradise.\\n           [JUNO and CERES whisper, and send IRIS on employment]\\n  PROSPERO. Sweet now, silence;\\n    Juno and Ceres whisper seriously.\\n    There's something else to do; hush, and be mute,\\n    Or else our spell is marr'd.\\n  IRIS. You nymphs, call'd Naiads, of the wind'ring brooks,\\n    With your sedg'd crowns and ever harmless looks,\\n    Leave your crisp channels, and on this green land\\n    Answer your summons; Juno does command.\\n    Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate\\n    A contract of true love; be not too late.\\n\\n                      Enter certain NYMPHS\\n\\n    You sun-burnt sicklemen, of August weary,\\n    Come hither from the furrow, and be merry;\\n    Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on,\\n    And these fresh nymphs encounter every one\\n    In country footing.\\n\\n        Enter certain REAPERS, properly habited; they join\\n         with the NYMPHS in a graceful dance; towards the\\n         end whereof PROSPERO starts suddenly, and speaks,\\n          after which, to a strange, hollow, and confused\\n                  noise, they heavily vanish\\n\\n  PROSPERO.  [Aside]  I had forgot that foul conspiracy\\n    Of the beast Caliban and his confederates\\n    Against my life; the minute of their plot\\n    Is almost come.  [To the SPIRITS]  Well done; avoid; no\\n    more!\\n  FERDINAND. This is strange; your father's in some passion\\n    That works him strongly.\\n  MIRANDA. Never till this day\\n    Saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd.\\n  PROSPERO. You do look, my son, in a mov'd sort,\\n    As if you were dismay'd; be cheerful, sir.\\n    Our revels now are ended. These our actors,\\n    As I foretold you, were all spirits, and\\n    Are melted into air, into thin air;\\n    And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,\\n    The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,\\n    The solemn temples, the great globe itself,\\n    Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,\\n    And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,\\n    Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff\\n    As dreams are made on; and our little life\\n    Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex'd;\\n    Bear with my weakness; my old brain is troubled;\\n    Be not disturb'd with my infirmity.\\n    If you be pleas'd, retire into my cell\\n    And there repose; a turn or two I'll walk\\n    To still my beating mind.\\n  FERDINAND, MIRANDA. We wish your peace.                 Exeunt\\n  PROSPERO. Come, with a thought. I thank thee, Ariel; come.\\n\\n                       Enter ARIEL\\n\\n  ARIEL. Thy thoughts I cleave to. What's thy pleasure?\\n  PROSPERO. Spirit,\\n    We must prepare to meet with Caliban.\\n  ARIEL. Ay, my commander. When I presented 'Ceres.'\\n    I thought to have told thee of it; but I fear'd\\n    Lest I might anger thee.\\n  PROSPERO. Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?\\n  ARIEL. I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;\\n    So full of valour that they smote the air\\n    For breathing in their faces; beat the ground\\n    For kissing of their feet; yet always bending\\n    Towards their project. Then I beat my tabor,\\n    At which like unback'd colts they prick'd their ears,\\n    Advanc'd their eyelids, lifted up their noses\\n    As they smelt music; so I charm'd their cars,\\n    That calf-like they my lowing follow'd through\\n    Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss, and thorns,\\n    Which ent'red their frail shins. At last I left them\\n    I' th' filthy mantled pool beyond your cell,\\n    There dancing up to th' chins, that the foul lake\\n    O'erstunk their feet.\\n  PROSPERO. This was well done, my bird.\\n    Thy shape invisible retain thou still.\\n    The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither\\n    For stale to catch these thieves.\\n  ARIEL. I go, I go.                                        Exit\\n  PROSPERO. A devil, a born devil, on whose nature\\n    Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,\\n    Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;\\n    And as with age his body uglier grows,\\n    So his mind cankers. I will plague them all,\\n    Even to roaring.\\n\\n       Re-enter ARIEL, loaden with glistering apparel, &c.\\n\\n    Come, hang them on this line.\\n                          [PROSPERO and ARIEL remain, invisible]\\n\\n         Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, all wet\\n\\n  CALIBAN. Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not\\n    Hear a foot fall; we now are near his cell.\\n  STEPHANO. Monster, your fairy, which you say is a harmless\\n    fairy, has done little better than play'd the Jack with us.\\n  TRINCULO. Monster, I do smell all horse-piss at which my\\n    nose is in great indignation.\\n  STEPHANO. So is mine. Do you hear, monster? If I should\\n    take a displeasure against you, look you-\\n  TRINCULO. Thou wert but a lost monster.\\n  CALIBAN. Good my lord, give me thy favour still.\\n    Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee to\\n    Shall hoodwink this mischance; therefore speak softly.\\n    All's hush'd as midnight yet.\\n  TRINCULO. Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool!\\n  STEPHANO. There is not only disgrace and dishonour in\\n    that, monster, but an infinite loss.\\n  TRINCULO. That's more to me than my wetting; yet this is\\n    your harmless fairy, monster.\\n  STEPHANO. I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er\\n    ears for my labour.\\n  CALIBAN. Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here,\\n    This is the mouth o' th' cell; no noise, and enter.\\n    Do that good mischief which may make this island\\n    Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,\\n    For aye thy foot-licker.\\n  STEPHANO. Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody\\n    thoughts.\\n  TRINCULO. O King Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano!\\n    Look what a wardrobe here is for thee!\\n  CALIBAN. Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.\\n  TRINCULO. O, ho, monster; we know what belongs to a\\n    frippery. O King Stephano!\\n  STEPHANO. Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I'll\\n    have that gown.\\n  TRINCULO. Thy Grace shall have it.\\n  CALIBAN. The dropsy drown this fool! What do you mean\\n    To dote thus on such luggage? Let 't alone,\\n    And do the murder first. If he awake,\\n    From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches;\\n    Make us strange stuff.\\n  STEPHANO. Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line, is not\\n    this my jerkin? Now is the jerkin under the line; now,\\n    jerkin, you are like to lose your hair, and prove a bald\\n    jerkin.\\n  TRINCULO. Do, do. We steal by line and level, an't like\\n    your Grace.\\n  STEPHANO. I thank thee for that jest; here's a garment\\n    for't. Wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of\\n    this country. 'Steal by line and level' is an excellent\\n    pass of pate; there's another garmet for't.\\n  TRINCULO. Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers,\\n    and away with the rest.\\n  CALIBAN. I will have none on't. We shall lose our time,\\n    And all be turn'd to barnacles, or to apes\\n    With foreheads villainous low.\\n  STEPHANO. Monster, lay-to your fingers; help to bear this\\n    away where my hogshead of wine is, or I'll turn you out\\n    of my kingdom. Go to, carry this.\\n  TRINCULO. And this.\\n  STEPHANO. Ay, and this.\\n\\n          A noise of hunters beard.

       " \"\\n\\nBefore PROSPERO'S cell\\n\\nEnter PROSPERO in his magic robes, and ARIEL\\n\\n  PROSPERO. Now does my project gather to a head;\\n    My charms crack not, my spirits obey; and time\\n    Goes upright with his carriage. How's the day?\\n  ARIEL. On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,\\n    You said our work should cease.\\n  PROSPERO. I did say so,\\n    When first I rais'd the tempest. Say, my spirit,\\n    How fares the King and 's followers?\\n  ARIEL. Confin'd together\\n    In the same fashion as you gave in charge;\\n    Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,\\n    In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;\\n    They cannot budge till your release. The King,\\n    His brother, and yours, abide all three distracted,\\n    And the remainder mourning over them,\\n    Brim full of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly\\n    Him you term'd, sir, 'the good old lord, Gonzalo';\\n    His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops\\n    From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works 'em\\n    That if you now beheld them your affections\\n    Would become tender.\\n  PROSPERO. Dost thou think so, spirit?\\n  ARIEL. Mine would, sir, were I human.\\n  PROSPERO. And mine shall.\\n    Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling\\n    Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,\\n    One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,\\n    Passion as they, be kindlier mov'd than thou art?\\n    Though with their high wrongs I am struck to th' quick,\\n    Yet with my nobler reason 'gainst my fury\\n    Do I take part; the rarer action is\\n    In virtue than in vengeance; they being penitent,\\n    The sole drift of my purpose doth extend\\n    Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel;\\n    My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore,\\n    And they shall be themselves.\\n  ARIEL. I'll fetch them, sir.                              Exit\\n  PROSPERO. Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and\\n    groves;\\n    And ye that on the sands with printless foot\\n    Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him\\n    When he comes back; you demi-puppets that\\n    By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,\\n    Whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime\\n    Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice\\n    To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid-\\n    Weak masters though ye be-I have be-dimm'd\\n    The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,\\n    And 'twixt the green sea and the azur'd vault\\n    Set roaring war. To the dread rattling thunder\\n    Have I given fire, and rifted Jove's stout oak\\n    With his own bolt; the strong-bas'd promontory\\n    Have I made shake, and by the spurs pluck'd up\\n    The pine and cedar. Graves at my command\\n    Have wak'd their sleepers, op'd, and let 'em forth,\\n    By my so potent art. But this rough magic\\n    I here abjure; and, when I have requir'd\\n    Some heavenly music-which even now I do-\\n    To work mine end upon their senses that\\n    This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,\\n    Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,\\n    And deeper than did ever plummet sound\\n    I'll drown my book.                            [Solem music]\\n\\n            Here enters ARIEL before; then ALONSO, with\\n          frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO; SEBASTIAN\\n           and ANTONIO in like manner, attended by ADRIAN\\n           and FRANCISCO. They all enter the circle which\\n          PROSPERO had made, and there stand charm'd; which\\n                    PROSPERO observing, speaks\\n\\n    A solemn air, and the best comforter\\n    To an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains,\\n    Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,\\n    For you are spell-stopp'd.\\n    Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,\\n    Mine eyes, ev'n sociable to the show of thine,\\n    Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,\\n    And as the morning steals upon the night,\\n    Melting the darkness, so their rising senses\\n    Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle\\n    Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,\\n    My true preserver, and a loyal sir\\n    To him thou follow'st! I will pay thy graces\\n    Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly\\n    Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter;\\n    Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.\\n    Thou art pinch'd for't now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,\\n    You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,\\n    Expell'd remorse and nature, who, with Sebastian-\\n    Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong-\\n    Would here have kill'd your king, I do forgive thee,\\n    Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding\\n    Begins to swell, and the approaching tide\\n    Will shortly fill the reasonable shore\\n    That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them\\n    That yet looks on me, or would know me. Ariel,\\n    Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell;           Exit ARIEL\\n    I will discase me, and myself present\\n    As I was sometime Milan. Quickly, spirit\\n    Thou shalt ere long be free.\\n\\n        ARIEL, on returning, sings and helps to attire him\\n\\n    Where the bee sucks, there suck I;\\n    In a cowslip's bell I lie;\\n    There I couch when owls do cry.\\n    On the bat's back I do fly\\n    After summer merrily.\\n    Merrily, merrily shall I live now\\n    Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.\\n\\n  PROSPERO. Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee;\\n    But yet thou shalt have freedom. So, so, so.\\n    To the King's ship, invisible as thou art;\\n    There shalt thou find the mariners asleep\\n    Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain\\n    Being awake, enforce them to this place;\\n    And presently, I prithee.\\n  ARIEL. I drink the air before me, and return\\n    Or ere your pulse twice beat.                           Exit\\n  GONZALO. All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement,\\n    Inhabits here. Some heavenly power guide us\\n    Out of this fearful country!\\n  PROSPERO. Behold, Sir King,\\n    The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero.\\n    For more assurance that a living prince\\n    Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;\\n    And to thee and thy company I bid\\n    A hearty welcome.\\n  ALONSO. Whe'er thou be'st he or no,\\n    Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,\\n    As late I have been, I not know. Thy pulse\\n    Beats, as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,\\n    Th' affliction of my mind amends, with which,\\n    I fear, a madness held me. This must crave-\\n    An if this be at all-a most strange story.\\n    Thy dukedom I resign, and do entreat\\n    Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero\\n    Be living and be here?\\n  PROSPERO. First, noble friend,\\n    Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot\\n    Be measur'd or confin'd.\\n  GONZALO. Whether this be\\n    Or be not, I'll not swear.\\n  PROSPERO. You do yet taste\\n    Some subtleties o' th' isle, that will not let you\\n    Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all!\\n    [Aside to SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO]  But you, my brace of\\n      lords, were I so minded,\\n    I here could pluck his Highness' frown upon you,\\n    And justify you traitors; at this time\\n    I will tell no tales.\\n  SEBASTIAN.  [Aside]  The devil speaks in him.\\n  PROSPERO. No.\\n    For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother\\n    Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive\\n    Thy rankest fault-all of them; and require\\n    My dukedom of thee, which perforce I know\\n    Thou must restore.\\n  ALONSO. If thou beest Prospero,\\n    Give us particulars of thy preservation;\\n    How thou hast met us here, whom three hours since\\n    Were wreck'd upon this shore; where I have lost-\\n    How sharp the point of this remembrance is!-\\n    My dear son Ferdinand.\\n  PROSPERO. I am woe for't, sir.\\n  ALONSO. Irreparable is the loss; and patience\\n    Says it is past her cure.\\n  PROSPERO. I rather think\\n    You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace\\n    For the like loss I have her sovereign aid,\\n    And rest myself content.\\n  ALONSO. You the like loss!\\n  PROSPERO. As great to me as late; and, supportable\\n    To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker\\n    Than you may call to comfort you, for I\\n    Have lost my daughter.\\n  ALONSO. A daughter!\\n    O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,\\n    The King and Queen there! That they were, I wish\\n    Myself were mudded in that oozy bed\\n    Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?\\n  PROSPERO. In this last tempest. I perceive these lords\\n    At this encounter do so much admire\\n    That they devour their reason, and scarce think\\n    Their eyes do offices of truth, their words\\n    Are natural breath; but, howsoe'er you have\\n    Been justled from your senses, know for certain\\n    That I am Prospero, and that very duke\\n    Which was thrust forth of Milan; who most strangely\\n    Upon this shore, where you were wrecked, was landed\\n    To be the lord on't. No more yet of this;\\n    For 'tis a chronicle of day by day,\\n    Not a relation for a breakfast, nor\\n    Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;\\n    This cell's my court; here have I few attendants,\\n    And subjects none abroad; pray you, look in.\\n    My dukedom since you have given me again,\\n    I will requite you with as good a thing;\\n    At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye\\n    As much as me my dukedom.\\n\\n          Here PROSPERO discovers FERDINAND and MIRANDA,\\n                      playing at chess\\n\\n  MIRANDA. Sweet lord, you play me false.\\n  FERDINAND. No, my dearest love,\\n    I would not for the world.\\n  MIRANDA. Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle\\n    And I would call it fair play.\\n  ALONSO. If this prove\\n    A vision of the island, one dear son\\n    Shall I twice lose.\\n  SEBASTIAN. A most high miracle!\\n  FERDINAND. Though the seas threaten, they are merciful;\\n    I have curs'd them without cause.                   [Kneels]\\n  ALONSO. Now all the blessings\\n    Of a glad father compass thee about!\\n    Arise, and say how thou cam'st here.\\n  MIRANDA. O, wonder!\\n    How many goodly creatures are there here!\\n    How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world\\n    That has such people in't!\\n  PROSPERO. 'Tis new to thee.\\n  ALONSO. What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?\\n    Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours;\\n    Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us,\\n    And brought us thus together?\\n  FERDINAND. Sir, she is mortal;\\n    But by immortal Providence she's mine.\\n    I chose her when I could not ask my father\\n    For his advice, nor thought I had one. She\\n    Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,\\n    Of whom so often I have heard renown\\n    But never saw before; of whom I have\\n    Receiv'd a second life; and second father\\n    This lady makes him to me.\\n  ALONSO. I am hers.\\n    But, O, how oddly will it sound that I\\n    Must ask my child forgiveness!\\n  PROSPERO. There, sir, stop;\\n    Let us not burden our remembrances with\\n    A heaviness that's gone.\\n  GONZALO. I have inly wept,\\n    Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you gods,\\n    And on this couple drop a blessed crown;\\n    For it is you that have chalk'd forth the way\\n    Which brought us hither.\\n  ALONSO. I say, Amen, Gonzalo!\\n  GONZALO. Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue\\n    Should become Kings of Naples? O, rejoice\\n    Beyond a common joy, and set it down\\n    With gold on lasting pillars: in one voyage\\n    Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis;\\n    And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife\\n    Where he himself was lost; Prospero his dukedom\\n    In a poor isle; and all of us ourselves\\n    When no man was his own.\\n  ALONSO.  [To FERDINAND and MIRANDA]  Give me your\\n    hands.\\n    Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart\\n    That doth not wish you joy.\\n  GONZALO. Be it so. Amen!\\n\\n           Re-enter ARIEL, with the MASTER and BOATSWAIN\\n                     amazedly following\\n\\n    O look, sir; look, sir! Here is more of us!\\n    I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,\\n    This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,\\n    That swear'st grace o'erboard, not an oath on shore?\\n    Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?\\n  BOATSWAIN. The best news is that we have safely found\\n    Our King and company; the next, our ship-\\n    Which but three glasses since we gave out split-\\n    Is tight and yare, and bravely rigg'd, as when\\n    We first put out to sea.\\n  ARIEL.  [Aside to PROSPERO]  Sir, all this service\\n    Have I done since I went.\\n  PROSPERO.  [Aside to ARIEL]  My tricksy spirit!\\n  ALONSO. These are not natural events; they strengthen\\n    From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?\\n  BOATSWAIN. If I did think, sir, I were well awake,\\n    I'd strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,\\n    And-how, we know not-all clapp'd under hatches;\\n    Where, but even now, with strange and several noises\\n    Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,\\n    And moe diversity of sounds, all horrible,\\n    We were awak'd; straightway at liberty;\\n    Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld\\n    Our royal, good, and gallant ship; our master\\n    Cap'ring to eye her. On a trice, so please you,\\n    Even in a dream, were we divided from them,\\n    And were brought moping hither.\\n  ARIEL.  [Aside to PROSPERO]  Was't well done?\\n  PROSPERO.  [Aside to ARIEL]  Bravely, my diligence. Thou\\n    shalt be free.\\n  ALONSO. This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod;\\n    And there is in this business more than nature\\n    Was ever conduct of. Some oracle\\n    Must rectify our knowledge.\\n  PROSPERO. Sir, my liege,\\n    Do not infest your mind with beating on\\n    The strangeness of this business; at pick'd leisure,\\n    Which shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you,\\n    Which to you shall seem probable, of every\\n    These happen'd accidents; till when, be cheerful\\n    And think of each thing well.  [Aside to ARIEL]  Come\\n    hither, spirit;\\n    Set Caliban and his companions free;\\n    Untie the spell.  [Exit ARIEL]  How fares my gracious sir?\\n    There are yet missing of your company\\n    Some few odd lads that you remember not.\\n\\n         Re-enter ARIEL, driving in CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and\\n\\n  TRINCULO, in their stolen apparel\\n  STEPHANO. Every man shift for all the rest, and let no man\\n    take care for himself; for all is but fortune. Coragio,\\n    bully-monster, coragio!\\n  TRINCULO. If these be true spies which I wear in my head,\\n    here's a goodly sight.\\n  CALIBAN. O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!\\n    How fine my master is! I am afraid\\n    He will chastise me.\\n  SEBASTIAN. Ha, ha!\\n    What things are these, my lord Antonio?\\n    Will money buy'em?\\n  ANTONIO. Very like; one of them\\n    Is a plain fish, and no doubt marketable.\\n  PROSPERO. Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,\\n    Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave-\\n    His mother was a witch, and one so strong\\n    That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,\\n    And deal in her command without her power.\\n    These three have robb'd me; and this demi-devil-\\n    For he's a bastard one-had plotted with them\\n    To take my life. Two of these fellows you\\n    Must know and own; this thing of darkness I\\n    Acknowledge mine.\\n  CALIBAN. I shall be pinch'd to death.\\n  ALONSO. Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?\\n  SEBASTIAN. He is drunk now; where had he wine?\\n  ALONSO. And Trinculo is reeling ripe; where should they\\n    Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em?\\n    How cam'st thou in this pickle?\\n  TRINCULO. I have been in such a pickle since I saw you\\n    last that, I fear me, will never out of my bones. I\\n    shall not fear fly-blowing.\\n  SEBASTIAN. Why, how now, Stephano!\\n  STEPHANO. O, touch me not; I am not Stephano, but a\\n    cramp.\\n  PROSPERO. You'd be king o' the isle, sirrah?\\n  STEPHANO. I should have been a sore one, then.\\n  ALONSO.  [Pointing to CALIBAN]  This is as strange a thing\\n    as e'er I look'd on.\\n  PROSPERO. He is as disproportioned in his manners\\n    As in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell;\\n    Take with you your companions; as you look\\n    To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.\\n  CALIBAN. Ay, that I will; and I'll be wise hereafter,\\n    And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass\\n    Was I to take this drunkard for a god,\\n    And worship this dull fool!\\n  PROSPERO. Go to; away!\\n  ALONSO. Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.\\n  SEBASTIAN. Or stole it, rather.\\n                          Exeunt CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO\\n  PROSPERO. Sir, I invite your Highness and your train\\n    To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest\\n    For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste\\n    With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it\\n    Go quick away-the story of my life,\\n    And the particular accidents gone by\\n    Since I came to this isle. And in the morn\\n    I'll bring you to your ship, and so to Naples,\\n    Where I have hope to see the nuptial\\n    Of these our dear-belov'd solemnized,\\n    And thence retire me to my Milan, where\\n    Every third thought shall be my grave.\\n  ALONSO. I long\\n    To hear the story of your life, which must\\n    Take the ear strangely.\\n  PROSPERO. I'll deliver all;\\n    And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales,\\n    And sail so expeditious that shall catch\\n    Your royal fleet far off.  [Aside to ARIEL]  My Ariel,\\n      chick,\\n    That is thy charge. Then to the elements\\n    Be free, and fare thou well!-Please you, draw near.\\n                                                          Exeunt\\n\\n\\n\\nEPILOGUE\\n                             EPILOGUE\\n                        Spoken by PROSPERO\\n\\n          Now my charms are all o'erthrown,\\n          And what strength I have's mine own,\\n          Which is most faint. Now 'tis true,\\n          I must be here confin'd by you,\\n          Or sent to Naples. Let me not,\\n          Since I have my dukedom got,\\n          And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell\\n          In this bare island by your spell;\\n          But release me from my bands\\n          With the help of your good hands.\\n          Gentle breath of yours my sails\\n          Must fill, or else my project fails,\\n          Which was to please. Now I want\\n          Spirits to enforce, art to enchant;\\n          And my ending is despair\\n          Unless I be reliev'd by prayer,\\n          Which pierces so that it assaults\\n          Mercy itself, and frees all faults.\\n          As you from crimes would pardon'd be,\\n          Let your indulgence set me free.\\n\\nTHE END\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM\\nSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS\\nPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY\\nWITH PERMISSION.
